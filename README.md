# Prompteus - We help diverse teams keep up with others changes

As companies grow, answering the simple question “What’s happening right now?” becomes increasingly hard. Information is spread across tools, projects, and teams, making it difficult to get a clear, high-level view. 
Weekly status reports and ad‑hoc “What’s going on?” questions drain developer time and still leave managers digging through GitHub with its barely working search functionality and pretty labour-intensive project management.

Teams need a zero‑friction way to surface work done, highlight blockers, and answer follow‑up questions—all in one place, automatically.
